# E-Commerce Shoe Store Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of our Fullstack E-Commerce Shoe Store project! This repository contains the server-side code built with Node.js and Strapi, serving as the headless CMS for managing content and data.

## Project Overview

This backend is designed to provide robust functionalities for our e-commerce platform. It handles user authentication, product management, order processing, and integrates with external services like Cloudinary for media management and Stripe for payment processing.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the backend up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasharyas/shoe-store-backend.git
   cd shoe-store-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
   ```plaintext

   CLOUDINARY_KEY=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_KEY>
   CLOUDINARY_SECRET=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_SECRET>
   STRIPE_API_SECRET=<YOUR_STRIPE_API_SECRET>
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
